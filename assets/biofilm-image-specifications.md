## IMAGE 1: "The Biofilm Problem"

### Concept
Show WHY treatments fail - bacteria hiding under a protective dome/shield that deflects antibiotics and immune cells.

### Visual Description

**Layout:** Horizontal composition, 16:9 or 4:3 ratio

**Main Elements:**
1. **The Biofilm Dome** (Center-dominant)
   - Translucent, slightly iridescent dome/shield
   - Color: Gradient from `#C47070` (edges) to semi-transparent coral center
   - Texture: Subtle gel-like, slimy appearance (but elegant, not gross)
   - Shape: Organic, irregular dome - NOT a perfect circle
   - Size: Takes up ~40% of composition

2. **Bacteria Inside the Dome** (Protected, thriving)
   - 5-7 small oval/rod shapes clustered underneath
   - Color: Deep coral `#C47070` with `#FECACA` highlights
   - Appearance: Safe, comfortable, multiplying
   - Body language: "Relaxed" - no stress indicators

3. **Antibiotics Bouncing Off** (Left side)
   - 3-4 pill/capsule shapes approaching dome
   - Color: Neutral gray `#9CA3AF` or muted blue
   - Motion lines showing deflection/bouncing
   - Some pills breaking apart or fading as they hit shield
   - Trajectory: Arrows showing deflection away

4. **Vaginal Wall Surface** (Bottom)
   - Subtle pink-toned tissue texture
   - Showing biofilm ATTACHED to surface
   - Color: Soft blush `#FDF2F8` with subtle texture

5. **Failed Immune Cells** (Right side, smaller)
   - 2-3 small white cells being blocked
   - Frustrated/deflected appearance

**Atmosphere:**
- Soft vignette effect
- The dome area feels protected, almost smug
- Outside elements feel frustrated, ineffective
